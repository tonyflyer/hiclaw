log_section "Phase 1-4: Assign 4-Phase Git Collaboration Task"

TASK_DESCRIPTION="Please coordinate a 4-phase git collaboration workflow to test non-linear multi-worker coordination.

Git repo URL (reachable from all worker containers): ${GIT_REPO_URL}
The repo has a 'main' branch with an initial commit.

⚠️ CRITICAL WORKER ASSIGNMENT TABLE — MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY, NO EXCEPTIONS:

| Phase | Assigned Worker | Trigger condition                     |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1     | alice           | start immediately                     |
| 2     | bob             | ONLY after alice reports PHASE1_DONE  |
| 3     | alice           | ONLY after bob reports REVISION_NEEDED|
| 4     | charlie         | ONLY after alice reports PHASE3_DONE  |

DO NOT assign any phase to a different worker. DO NOT give alice phase 2 or phase 4. DO NOT give bob phase 1 or phase 3. DO NOT give charlie any phase except phase 4. Each phase must be done by the worker listed above and no one else.

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the EXACT branch names and file paths specified below. Do not rename, substitute, or simplify them. The verification system checks these exact names.

Before starting any phase:
1. Ensure workers with usernames exactly 'alice', 'bob', and 'charlie' exist with the git-delegation skill. The username (container name) must match exactly — do not use variations like 'alice-dev' or 'bob-backend'.
2. Create a shared project room that includes alice, bob, charlie, and the human admin (use the create-project.sh script). All phase assignments and reports MUST happen in this project room — never in individual worker rooms.

Run the phases strictly in order, waiting for each phase's report before starting the next.

**Phase 1 — alice (and only alice)**:
- Clone ${GIT_REPO_URL}
- Create branch named EXACTLY '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' from main (do not use any other name)
- Create file at path EXACTLY 'doc/proposal.md' with this content:
  # Project Proposal

  ## Background
  This project aims to improve team collaboration.

  ## Goals
  - Faster delivery
  - Better quality
- Commit with message 'feat: add proposal' and push branch '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' to ${GIT_REPO_URL}
- Report PHASE1_DONE

**Phase 2 — bob and only bob** (assign to bob, NOT alice, only after alice reports PHASE1_DONE):
- Clone ${GIT_REPO_URL}, check out branch '${FEATURE_BRANCH}', read doc/proposal.md
- Create branch named EXACTLY '${REVIEW_BRANCH}' from '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' (do not use any other name)
- Create file at path EXACTLY 'reviews/proposal-review.md' with this content:
  # Review

  The proposal looks good. Please add a ## Summary section at the top that briefly describes the project in one sentence.
- Commit 'review: request summary section' and push branch '${REVIEW_BRANCH}' to ${GIT_REPO_URL}
- Report REVISION_NEEDED

**Phase 3 — alice and only alice** (assign back to alice, NOT bob, only after bob reports REVISION_NEEDED):
- Work on branch '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' (not a new branch)
- Read bob's review file at path 'reviews/proposal-review.md' on branch '${REVIEW_BRANCH}'
- Edit 'doc/proposal.md' on branch '${FEATURE_BRANCH}': add a '## Summary' section immediately after the '# Project Proposal' title line, with one sentence describing the project
- Commit 'fix: add summary section per review' and push branch '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' to ${GIT_REPO_URL}
- Report PHASE3_DONE

**Phase 4 — charlie and only charlie** (assign to charlie, NOT alice or bob, only after alice reports PHASE3_DONE):
- Clone ${GIT_REPO_URL}, create branch named EXACTLY '${TEST_BRANCH}' from '${FEATURE_BRANCH}' (do not use any other name)
- Create file at path EXACTLY 'verify/checklist.md' confirming: (1) proposal.md has a Summary section, (2) Goals section is present, (3) review was addressed
- Commit 'verify: proposal review checklist' and push branch '${TEST_BRANCH}' to ${GIT_REPO_URL}
- Report PHASE4_DONE

When all 4 phases are done, post a final summary in the project room and @mention the human admin to notify them the workflow is complete."
