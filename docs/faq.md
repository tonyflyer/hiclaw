## How to check the current HiClaw version

Run the following command to see the installed version:

```bash
docker exec hiclaw-manager cat /opt/hiclaw/agent/.builtin-version
```

To install a specific version, use the `HICLAW_VERSION` environment variable during installation:

```bash
HICLAW_VERSION=0.1.0 bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)
```

---

## Installation script exits immediately on Windows

If the PowerShell installation script closes immediately after launching, first check whether Docker Desktop is installed. If it is installed, make sure it is actually running — Docker Desktop must be started and fully loaded before the script can connect to the Docker daemon.

---

## Manager Agent startup timeout

If the Manager Agent is unresponsive after installation, check the logs inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it hiclaw-manager cat /var/log/hiclaw/manager-agent.log
```

**Case 1: Log shows a process exit**

The Docker VM may not have enough memory. Increase it to at least 4GB: Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory. Then re-run the install command.

**Case 2: No process exit in logs, but some components won't start**

This is likely caused by stale config data. Re-run the install command from the original install directory and choose **delete and reinstall**:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://higress.ai/hiclaw/install.sh)
```

When the installer detects an existing installation, it will ask how to proceed. Choosing delete will wipe the stale data and start fresh.

## Accessing the web UI from other devices on the LAN

**Accessing Element Web**

On another device on the same network, open a browser and go to:

```
http://<LAN-IP>:18088
```

The browser may warn about an insecure connection — ignore it and click Continue.

**Updating the Matrix Server address**

The default Matrix Server hostname resolves to `localhost`, which won't work from other devices. When logging into Element Web, change the Matrix Server address to:

```
http://<LAN-IP>:18080
```

For example, if your LAN IP is `192.168.1.100`, enter `http://192.168.1.100:18080`.

---

## Cannot connect to Matrix server locally

If the Matrix server is unreachable even on the local machine, check whether a proxy is enabled in your browser or system. The `*-local.hiclaw.io` domain resolves to `127.0.0.1` by default — if traffic is routed through a proxy, requests will never reach the local server.

Disable the proxy, or add `*-local.hiclaw.io` / `127.0.0.1` to your proxy bypass list.

## How to talk to a Worker directly

After creating a Worker, Manager automatically adds you and the Worker to a shared group room. In that room, you must **@mention the Worker** for it to respond — messages without a mention are ignored.

When using Element or similar clients, type `@` followed by the first letter(s) of the Worker's display name to trigger autocomplete and select the right user.

Alternatively, you can click the Worker's avatar and open a **direct message** (DM) conversation. In a DM you don't need to @mention — every message triggers the Worker. Keep in mind that Manager is not in the DM room and won't see any of that conversation.

## How to switch the Manager's model

**Single provider**

In the Higress console, configure the `default-ai-route` route to point to your LLM provider. Then tell Manager the exact model name you want to use (e.g. `qwen3.5-plus`). Manager will run a connectivity test with that model name first — if it passes, the switch is applied automatically.

**Multiple providers**

In the Higress console, create multiple AI routes — each with a different model name matching rule (prefix or regex) pointing to the corresponding provider. After that, the process is the same as the single-provider case — just tell Manager the model name and it handles the rest.

Reference: [Higress AI Quick Start — Console Configuration](https://higress.ai/en/docs/ai/quick-start#console-configuration)

---

## How to switch a Worker's model

The process is similar to switching the Manager's model, and Manager handles it for you in both cases.

**At creation time**: When asking Manager to create a Worker, specify the model name directly, e.g. "Create a Worker named alice using `qwen3.5-plus`."

**After creation**: Tell Manager at any time to switch a Worker's model, e.g. "Switch alice to use `claude-3-5-sonnet`." Manager will update the Worker's configuration accordingly.

Make sure the Higress `default-ai-route` is already configured to route the target model name to the right provider before switching.

## Does HiClaw support sending and receiving files

**Receiving files from you**: Yes. You can upload a file directly in Element Web (the attachment button), and Manager or Worker will receive it as a Matrix media message and can read its content.

**Sending files to you**: Yes. When you ask Manager (or a Worker) to send you a file — such as a task output artifact, a generated report, or any file it has access to — it will upload the file to the Matrix media server and send it to the room as a downloadable attachment. You can then click to download it in Element Web.

## Why does Manager/Worker keep showing "typing"

This is normal — it means the underlying OpenClaw agent engine is actively executing. HiClaw sets a 30-minute timeout per task, so an agent can stay in this state for up to 30 minutes while working.

To see what the agent is actually doing, exec into the Manager or Worker container and check the session logs:

```bash
# For Manager
docker exec -it hiclaw-manager ls /root/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/

# For a Worker (replace <worker-name> with the actual container name)
docker exec -it <worker-name> ls /root/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/
```

The `.jsonl` files in that directory are written by OpenClaw in real time and contain the full agent execution trace — LLM calls, tool use, reasoning steps, etc.

---

## Manager not responding or returning error status codes

If Manager stops responding or you see error codes like 404 or 503, check the Higress AI Gateway log:

```bash
docker exec -it hiclaw-manager cat /var/log/hiclaw/higress-gateway.log
```

Search the log for the relevant status code. Common causes:

- **503**: The container can't reach the external LLM service — likely a network issue inside the container.
- **404**: The model name is probably wrong.

To determine whether the error came from the backend or from a Higress misconfiguration, check the `upstream_host` field in the log entry. If `upstream_host` has a value, the request reached the backend and the error was returned by the upstream service. If it's empty, Higress itself couldn't route the request.

## How to connect Feishu/DingTalk/WeCom/Discord/Telegram

HiClaw Manager is built on OpenClaw, which supports multiple messaging channels out of the box. To connect additional channels:

**Method 1: Edit config directly**

The Manager's working directory is `~/hiclaw-manager` (on your host). Edit `openclaw.json` in that directory to add channel configuration. Refer to [OpenClaw channel documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai) for the specific config format for each platform.

After editing, restart the Manager container for changes to take effect:

```bash
docker restart hiclaw-manager
```

**Method 2: Let Manager learn from your existing OpenClaw config**

If you already use OpenClaw with other channels (e.g., in your personal setup), you can let Manager read your existing config:

- **Tell Manager where the file is**: In Element Web, tell Manager the path to your OpenClaw config file (e.g., "My OpenClaw config is at `/home/user/my-openclaw.json`"). Manager will read it directly.
- **Send the file as attachment**: In Element Web or any Matrix client, upload your config file as an attachment and send it to Manager. Manager will receive and read it.

Then ask Manager to help configure the same channels in its own config.
